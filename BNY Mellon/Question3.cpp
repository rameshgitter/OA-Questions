/*
HackerLand has a network of warehouses which can be represented as an undirected rooted weighted tree consisting of warehouse nodes number of nodes, rooted at warehouse 1. 
There are (warehouse nodes-1) roads connecting them, and warehouse weight[i] denotes the distance covered by the road. 
Moreover, each warehouse has a value assigned to it denoted by the array val.

A pair of warehouses (u, v) is said to be compatible if it satisfies the following conditions:

uis an ancestor of vin the tree network. distanceÄ¼u, vis vallv), where distance(u, v) represents the sum of distances of roads that belong to the simple path connecting u and v


Find the number of compatible pairs of warehouses.

Complete the countCompatiblePairs function below.

The function is expected to return a LONG INTEGER The function accepts following parameters:

1. WEIGHTED INTEGER GRAPH warehouse

2. INTEGER ARRAY val

For the weighted graph, <name>:

1. The number of nodes is <name> nodes.

2. The number of edges is <name> edges.

3. An edge exists between <name> from[1] and <name>_to[1]. The weight of the edge is <name> weigh
